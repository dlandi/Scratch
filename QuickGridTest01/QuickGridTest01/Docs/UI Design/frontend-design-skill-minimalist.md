# Frontend Design Skill: Refined Minimalism

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade minimalist interfaces that avoid generic "startup clean" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to restraint, precision, and subtle sophistication.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a REFINED minimalist direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? What should users focus on?
- **Refinement Style**: Pick a minimalist flavor: Swiss/International, Japanese wabi-sabi, Scandinavian hygge, Bauhaus functional, medical/clinical precision, architectural whitespace, monastic/contemplative, typographic hierarchy, grid-systematic, or material honesty. There are many approaches to minimalism. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE despite minimal elements? What's the one subtle detail someone will notice?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with surgical precision. Refined minimalism requires MORE intentionality than maximalism - every element must earn its place. Restraint is a design decision, not a lack of ideas.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Quietly sophisticated and memorable through subtlety
- Cohesive with a clear minimalist point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in spacing, proportion, and hierarchy

## Minimalist Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

### Typography

Choose fonts with precision and character. Avoid default system stacks; opt for fonts with refined details and subtle personality. Font weight variations matter enormously - use 300/400/500 weights strategically. Pair fonts with contrasting characteristics (geometric + humanist, serif + sans-serif with complementary x-heights). Obsess over letter-spacing, line-height, and measure.

### Color & Theme

Commit to severe restraint. Use CSS variables for consistency. Monochrome with ONE carefully chosen accent that appears sparingly outperforms evenly-distributed color. Consider: pure black/white, near-black/off-white, warm grays, cool grays, single muted accent. Temperature (warm vs cool) creates subtle mood.

### Motion

Use micro-animations that whisper rather than shout. Prioritize CSS-only solutions. Focus on: subtle state transitions (0.15-0.3s easing), delicate hover reveals, gentle scroll-triggered opacity/position shifts, carefully timed sequential reveals. Avoid bouncy or elastic easing - prefer cubic-bezier curves that feel precise.

### Spatial Composition

Ruthless hierarchy through whitespace. Embrace generous negative space. Use mathematical spacing scales (8pt grid, modular scale). Asymmetry through intentional imbalance. Single-column layouts with breathing room. Generous margins that feel luxurious not empty.

### Backgrounds & Visual Details

Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) - use warm whites (cream) or cool whites (blue-gray tint). Subtle textures add tactility: barely-visible paper grain, micro-gradients (2-3% value shift), subtle vignettes, imperceptible noise overlays. Details should be discovered not announced.

## Anti-Patterns: Generic Minimalism

**NEVER** use generic minimalism like:

- Default system fonts
- Pure black text on pure white (#000 on #FFF)
- Centered-everything layouts
- Equidistant spacing
- Symmetrical grids without intentional tension
- Overly rounded corners (8px+ border-radius everywhere)
- Thin hairline borders everywhere (1px #E0E0E0)
- Predictable component patterns that lack specific character

Interpret minimalism as intentional restraint, not lack of creativity. Every element should have purpose. Empty space should create tension and focus. No design should feel like a wireframe or unfinished prototype.

## Implementation Standards

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation precision to the aesthetic vision. Minimalist designs need exacting code:

- Precise spacing systems (8pt grid, modular scale)
- Careful attention to typography hierarchy
- Pristine alignment and grid discipline
- Subtle micro-interactions that enhance without distracting
- Elegant execution of simple elements

Elegance comes from perfect execution of simple elements.

## Philosophy

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back - show what can be created when committing fully to refined restraint and subtle sophistication.

Refined minimalism is arguably **more demanding** than maximalism because it requires getting every micro-detail perfect - there's nowhere to hide.
